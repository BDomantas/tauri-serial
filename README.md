# Tauri Plugin - SerialPort

This plugin enables Tauri applications to communicate with serial ports, allowing for the reading and writing of data to and from connected serial devices. To manage child processes instead, consider using the [`shell`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-plugin-shell) plugin.

## Installation

_This plugin requires Rust version **1.70** or higher._

There are three recommended methods for installing this plugin:

1. **Using crates.io and npm** (easiest, requires trust in our publishing pipeline)
2. **Directly from GitHub using git tags/revision hashes** (most secure)
3. **Git submodule in your Tauri project, then using the file protocol for source inclusion** (most secure but less convenient)

### Core Plugin

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file under `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
tauri-plugin-serialport = "2.0.0-beta"
```

### JavaScript Bindings

Install using your preferred package manager:

```sh
pnpm add tauri-plugin-serialplugin
# or
npm add tauri-plugin-serialplugin
# or
yarn add tauri-plugin-serialplugin

# For direct GitHub installation:
pnpm add https://github.com/s00d/tauri-plugin-serialplugin#v2
# or
npm add https://github.com/s00d/tauri-plugin-serialplugin#v2
# or
yarn add https://github.com/s00d/tauri-plugin-serialport#v2
```

## Usage

First, register the core plugin within your Tauri application's main setup:

`src-tauri/src/main.rs`

```rust
fn main() {
    tauri::Builder::default()
        .plugin(tauri_plugin_serialplugin::init())
        .run(tauri::generate_context!())
        .expect("error while running tauri application");
}
```

After registration, you can access the plugin's APIs through the provided JavaScript bindings:

```javascript
import { SerialPort } from "tauri-plugin-serialplugin";

// Example: Listing available serial ports
async function listPorts() {
  const ports = await SerialPort.available_ports();
  console.log(ports);
}

listPorts();
```
